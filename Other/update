* Fixed incorrect degrees -> sensitivity algorithm

Here's a way to find the pixels you need to turn:
Get initial degrees
convert to sensitivity by doing degrees * 25/9
now to actually find pixels:
get the result of the following: log2(sensitivity / 100) (this is equivalent to log(sensitivity/100) / log(2))
this gives us our factor, round it up please !
now divide the sensitivity by 2 ^ factor
^ this returns the sensitivity required
now divide the original amount of degrees by its sensitivity and round up
